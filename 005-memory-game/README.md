# Live Coding Challenge

Create a memory game where users have to match cards into pairs. 

**Rules:**
1. Users are presented with 10 pairs of matching cards (20 cards total) in random order.

2. The cards are displayed for 3 seconds, then they all flip over to hide their values.

3. Users can turn over 2 cards at a time. 
  a. If the cards match, they should indicate a match, and stay turned over.
  b. If the cards don't match, they should both be flipped back over. 

4. The user continues this methodology until all the cards are solved.

**Tasks to complete:**

1. Create a metholody for the cards to be displayed to the screen with 10 matching pairs in random order. 

2. Create a way for the cards to be "flipped" from front to back.

3. Display the cards (face-up) for 3 seconds at the beginning and then flip them all face-down.

4. Allow two cards (at most) to be flipped at a time and,
   a. if they match, indicate a match and keep them flipped up.
   b. if they don't match flip them back over. 

5. Allow the restart button to restart the application.
